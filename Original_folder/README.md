# CS 340 Project Two – Original Artifact

The version in these files represents the original submission of my CS 340 prior for CS 340 Client/Server and Development to enhancements made for the CS 499 ePortfolio.

The project demonstrates:
- Importing a CSV dataset into MongoDB
- Performing CRUD operations by using Python
- Querying data from a MongoDB collection
- Visualizing results using Plotly in a Jupyter Notebook

Files included:
- `ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that queries the database and displays tables, charts, and a map.
- `crud_module.py`: Python module containing reusable CRUD functions used by the notebook.
